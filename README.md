"Arduino-Based Automatic Plant Irrigation System with Message Alert"

System Overview:
  *This system uses Arduino to automate plant irrigation by monitoring soil moisture levels.
  *When the moisture level falls below a set threshold, the system triggers a relay to turn on the water pump, irrigating the plants. 
  *Additionally, it sends a message alert to the user's phone via GSM module.

Benefits:

  1. Automated irrigation saves time and effort.
  2. Optimized water usage reduces waste and conserves this precious resource.
  3. Message alerts inform the user of irrigation status and potential issues.
  4. Improved plant health and growth due to consistent and optimal watering.

Applications:

  1. Home gardening
  2. Greenhouses
  3. Agricultural fields
  4. Landscaping and lawn care
